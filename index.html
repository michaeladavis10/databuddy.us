                <p class="section-intro">At DataBuddy, we believe data consulting should be clear and focused. Our
                    approach is designed to cut through complexity and provide you with a straightforward path to
                    achieving your business goals. Consider these analogies:</p>

                        <p class="analogy-text">Imagine you want to run a marathon, but you have knee pain. The doctor
                            diagnoses the pain, the physical therapist gives you exercises, and the insurance company
                            dictates the treatment. Each specialist solves their piece of the puzzle, but no one is
                            focused on your actual goal: running the marathon. You're left to navigate this complex
                            system alone, acting as your own advocate.</p>
                        <p class="analogy-text" style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>This is exactly how businesses
                                experience data problems.</strong> You're sold a dashboard tool, a cloud platform, and a
                            consulting workshop, but no one is accountable for the business result. DataBuddy acts as
                            your performance coach and advocate. We start with your ultimate goal—the marathon—and build
                            the single, cohesive strategy that gets you across the finish line.</p>

                        <p class="analogy-text">Think about managing your business's finances. You're an expert in your
                            industry, but not a tax accountant or corporate lawyer. You know you need to optimize for
                            growth, but you're wary of advisors with hidden fees or their own agendas. You don't know
                            who to trust or what questions to ask.</p>
                        <p class="analogy-text" style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>This is how many owners feel about
                                their data.</strong> The landscape of vendors and tools is confusing and expensive.
                            DataBuddy acts as your trusted advisor, but for your data. We speak your language—business
                            outcomes—and demystify the technical world, ensuring you never overspend on technology you
                            don't need and that every decision aligns with your long-term goals.</p>

                                <p class="about-text">DataBuddy was founded on a simple premise: business owners deserve
                                    a technical partner who operates with an owner's mindset. Years spent building
                                    massive data systems for world-class tech companies—including <strong>LinkedIn,
                                        TripAdvisor, and Snowflake</strong>—revealed a clear gap between
                                    enterprise-level strategy and the practical, bottom-line needs of most businesses.
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-text">Our approach is to act as the advocate every business owner wishes
                                    they had. We translate complex technical options into clear business outcomes. This
                                    perspective is grounded in direct experience, not just as technical experts, but
                                    also as business owners through our work acquiring and advising SMBs. The focus is
                                    always on straight answers and practical solutions that generate real ROI.</p>
                                <p class="about-text">The work is defined by a framework of discipline and execution,
                                    honed through a background that includes competing as a D1 athlete and finishing
                                    multiple Ironman triathlons. The methodology is simple: perform the deep analysis
                                    required to solve the right problem, and deliver lasting value, not just billable
                                    hours.</p>

                            <p class="card-text"><strong>Solution:</strong> As part-time consultants, we diagnosed the
