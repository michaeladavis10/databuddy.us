                    a straightforward path to achieving your business goals. Consider these analogies:

                            Imagine you want to run a marathon, but you have knee pain. You see a doctor, a physical
                            therapist, and a pharmacist. Each is an expert, but no one is focused on your actual goal:
                            running the marathon. This is how most businesses approach data. DataBuddy acts as your
                            performance coach. We start with your business goal—the marathon—and build a single,
